## Fight OCD in your browser!

By solving simple problems you gain trust and confidence in yourself - this should help fighting [Obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder). 

The main idea is to check how well you remember sequences of numbers and letters - a common task in everyday life, e.g. when filling in documents. OCD makes me recheck phone/passport numbers ridiculous number of times, because of constant doubts. Hope this app will help not only me but also you if you experience something similar ðŸ˜ƒ
